# Replicache Vercel Template

Replicache is a framework for creating multiplayer web applications.

Replicache enables:

* **Realtime collaboration:** Users see each others' changes as they happen, without any reloads.
* **Instant UI:** The UI responds to changes instantly, without waiting for server round trips. Everything is optimistic, automatically.
* **Offline resilience:** Applications can go offline for minutes or hours and sync up smoothly when they come back online.

To learn more about Replicache, see [replicache.dev](https://replicache.dev/).

This template creates a full Replicache-powered todo list powered by Vercel, Next.js, and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/). You can use this as the basis for your own Replicache powered app.

## Install

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

- Create a new project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

### Step 2: Deploy this Template

- When you get to the Replicache integration you'll have to provide the database password you saved in step 1.
